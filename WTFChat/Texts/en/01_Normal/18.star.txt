A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity.
Most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth.
The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate.
The star's internal pressure prevents it from collapsing further under its own gravity.
A star with mass greater than 0.4 times the Sun's will expand to become a red giant when the hydrogen fuel in its core is exhausted.
As the star expands it throws a part of its mass, enriched with those heavier elements, into the interstellar environment, to be recycled later as new stars.
Binary and multi-star systems consist of two or more stars that are gravitationally bound and generally move around each other in stable orbits.
Stars have been part of religious practices and used for celestial navigation and orientation.
Many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable.
Many of the constellations and star names in use today derive from Greek astronomy.
Parallax measurements demonstrated the vast separation of the stars in the heavens.
Stars condense from regions of space of higher density, yet those regions are less dense than within a vacuum chamber.
Most stars form in groups of dozens to hundreds of thousands of stars.
All stars spend the majority of their existence as main sequence stars, fueled primarily by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium within their cores.
Most stars are observed to be members of binary star systems.
Every star generates a stellar wind of particles that causes a continual outflow of gas into space.
Massive stars consume their fuel very rapidly and are short-lived. Low mass stars consume their fuel very slowly.
During their helium-burning phase, stars of more than nine solar masses expand to form red supergiants.
The blown-off outer layers of dying stars include heavy elements, which may be recycled during the formation of new stars.
Most stars are between 1 billion and 10 billion years old.
The most massive stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) can last tens to hundreds of billions of years.
The combination of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity.
Young stars can have a rotation greater than 100Â km/s at the equator.
The luminosity of a star is the amount of light and other forms of radiant energy it radiates per unit of time.
Many stars do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface.
Patches of the star's surface with a lower temperature and luminosity than average are known as starspots.
The interior of a stable star is in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium: the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other.
The photosphere is that portion of a star that is visible to an observer.
From the corona, a stellar wind of plasma particles expands outward from the star, until it interacts with the interstellar medium.
A variety of nuclear fusion reactions take place in the cores of stars, that depend upon their mass and composition.
