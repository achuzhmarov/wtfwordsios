Wind
Wind
In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space.
Planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space.
The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn.
Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts.
Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls.
Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as breeze, gale, storm, and hurricane.
In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.
Hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption.
Winds can shape landforms, via a variety of aeolian processes such as the formation of fertile soils, such as loess, and by erosion.
Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds.
Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations.
Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.
When a difference in atmospheric pressure exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds.
At airports, windsocks indicate wind direction, and can also be used to estimate wind speed by the angle of hang.
The strongest winds are in the mid-latitudes where cold polar air meets warm air from the tropics.
The trade winds (also called trades) are the prevailing pattern of easterly surface winds found in the tropics towards the Earth's equator.
The trade winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere.
The trade winds act as the steering flow for tropical cyclones that form over the world's oceans.
A monsoon is a seasonal prevailing wind that lasts for several months within tropical regions.
When large-scale winds are calm, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea.
Winds that flow over mountains down into lower elevations are known as downslope winds. These winds are warm and dry.
Wind speeds during downslope wind effect can exceed 160 kilometers per hour (99Â mph).
As a natural force, the wind was often personified as one or more wind gods or as an expression of the supernatural in many cultures.
Kamikaze is a Japanese word, usually translated as divine wind, believed to be a gift from the gods.
Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation.
Wind limits tree growth.
When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as windthrow.
Even a soft wind will cause a low level of environmental noise. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies.
Infrequent wind gusts can cause poorly designed suspension bridges to sway.
