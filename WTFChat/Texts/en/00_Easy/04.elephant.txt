Elephant
Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes.
Elephants are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments.
Elephants have a fission–fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise.
Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild.
Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans.
Elephants appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.
African elephants are listed as vulnerable, while the Asian elephant is classed as endangered.
One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks.
Elephants are used as working animals in Asia.
In the past elephants were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in circuses.
Elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals.
The skeleton of the elephant is made up of 326–351 bones.
An elephant's skull is resilient enough to withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions.
The trunk is a fusion of the nose and upper lip, although in early fetal life, the upper lip and trunk are separated.
The trunk is elongated and specialised to become the elephant's most important and versatile appendage.
The trunk contains up to 150,000 separate muscle fascicles, with no bone and little fat.
Elephant trunks have multiple functions, including breathing, olfaction, touching, grasping, and sound production.
The trunk's ability to make powerful twisting and coiling movements allows it to collect food, wrestle with conspecifics, and lift up to 350 kg (770 lb).
With its trunk, an elephant can reach items at heights of up to 7 m (23 ft) and dig for water under mud or sand.
An adult Asian elephant is capable of holding 8.5 L (2.2 US gal) of water in its trunk.
When underwater, the elephant uses its trunk as a snorkel.
The African elephant has two finger-like extensions at the tip of the trunk that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth.
Like humans, who are typically right- or left-handed, elephants are usually right- or left-tusked.
Hunting for elephant ivory in Africa and Asia has led to natural selection for shorter tusks and tusklessness.
An elephant's skin is generally very tough, at 2.5 cm (1 in) thick on the back and parts of the head.
An elephant uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting its skin from ultraviolet light.
