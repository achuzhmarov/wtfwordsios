Cabbage heads generally range from 0.5 to 4 kilograms (1 to 9 lb), and can be green, purple and white.
Smooth-leafed firm-headed green cabbages are the most common, with smooth-leafed red and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colors seen more rarely.
Under conditions of long sunlit days such as are found at high northern latitudes in summer, cabbages can grow much larger.
