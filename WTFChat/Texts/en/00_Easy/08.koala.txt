Koala
The koala is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia.
Koala is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose.
The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb).
Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet.
Koalas are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring.
Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates.
Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests.
Koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives.
Koalas were hunted by indigenous Australians and depicted in myths and cave art for millennia.
The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published in 1810.
During the Oligocene and Miocene, koalas lived in rainforests and had less specialised diets.
The species is sexually dimorphic, with males 50% larger than females.
Males are distinguished from females by their more curved noses and the presence of chest glands, which are visible as hairless patches.
The koala has the most effective insulating back fur of any marsupial and is highly resilient to wind and rain.
The koala has a cartilaginous pad at the end of the spine that may make it more comfortable when it perches in the fork of a tree.
The koala has one of the smallest brains in proportion to body weight of any mammal.
The koala's small brain size may be an adaptation to the energy restrictions imposed by its diet, which is insufficient to sustain a larger brain.
The koala's olfactory senses are normal, and it is known to sniff the oils of individual branchlets to assess their edibility.
The koala's round ears provide it with good hearing, and it has a well-developed middle ear.
Koalas usually survive falls from trees and immediately climb back up.
Early European settlers in Australia considered the koala to be a prowling sloth-like animal with a "fierce and menacing look".
Koalas were hunted for food by Aboriginals.
The koala was heavily hunted by European settlers in the early 20th century, largely for its thick, soft fur.
While urbanisation can pose a threat to koala populations, the animals can survive in urban areas provided enough trees are present.
