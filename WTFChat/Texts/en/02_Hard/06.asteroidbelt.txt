Asteroid belt
The asteroid belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter.
The asteroid belt is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets.
The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon.
Ceres, the asteroid belt's only dwarf planet, is about 950 km in diameter.
The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it without incident.
The asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals.
A total of 1,000 asteroids had been found by 1921, 10,000 by 1981, and 100,000 by 2000.
Today, most scientNeverthelessists accept that, rather than fragmenting from a progenitor planet, the asteroids never formed a planet at all.
Planetesimals within the region which would become the asteroid belt were too strongly perturbed by Jupiter's gravity to form a planet.
The current asteroid belt is believed to contain only a small fraction of the mass of the primordial belt.
Computer simulations suggest that the original asteroid belt may have contained mass equivalent to the Earth.
Contrary to popular imagery, the asteroid belt is mostly empty.
The asteroids are spread over such a large volume that it would be improbable to reach an asteroid without aiming carefully.
Hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff.
Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100 km.
The asteroid belt has 0.7–1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1 km or more.
The four largest objects account for half of the asteroid belt's total mass, with almost one-third accounted for by Ceres alone.
Carbonaceous asteroids, as their name suggests, are carbon-rich. They dominate the asteroid belt's outer regions.
S-type (silicate-rich) asteroids are more common toward the inner region of the asteroid belt, within 2.5 AU of the Sun.
M-type (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of the asteroid belt; their spectra resemble that of iron-nickel.
One mystery of the asteroid belt is the relative rarity of V-type, or basaltic asteroids.
Sometimes, the term main belt is used to refer only to the more compact "core" region where the greatest concentration of bodies is found.
Collisions between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10 km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years.
Collisions that occur at low relative speeds may join two asteroids.
Of the 50,000 meteorites found on Earth to date, 99.8 percent are believed to have originated in the asteroid belt.
Most belt asteroids imaged to date have come from brief flyby opportunities by probes headed for other targets.
